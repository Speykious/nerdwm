# NerdWM

NerdWM is a simple Unix window manager. This is just a small side project I am working on in my free time, with the intention of learning X11 and how window managers work.

Contributions are welcome but the primary goal of this project at the moment is learning.

## Features I will eventually try to add

- Workspaces
- A simple configuration format
- Plugin interface <sup>(something I want to try to implement as I have never done this before)</sup>
