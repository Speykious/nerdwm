# NerdWM

NerdWM is a simple X11 window manager. This is just a small side project I am working on in my free time, with the intention of learning X11 and how window managers work.

Contributions are welcome but the primary goal of this project at the moment is learning.

## Features I will eventually try to add

- Workspaces
  - Each with their own mode
    - Purely Floating (with decorated windows)
    - Tiling (tiled windows by default but floating windows can exist)
    - Fullscreen
- Plugin interface
